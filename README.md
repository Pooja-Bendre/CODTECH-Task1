**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT :**
**PROJECT EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) ON WORLD POPULATION** 

**Project Title:** Exploring World Population Trends

**Project Description:**

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project delves into the world population dataset, examining trends, patterns, and correlations. Using data visualization and statistical techniques, we aim to uncover insights on population distribution, growth, and demographic changes.

**Objectives:**

1. Analyze population distribution across regions and countries.
2. Examine population growth rates and trends over time.
3. Investigate correlations between population and economic indicators (e.g., GDP, life expectancy).
4. Identify demographic shifts and patterns (e.g., urbanization, age distribution).

**Dataset:**

- Source: United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division
- Dataset: World Population Prospects 2024
- Variables: Population, region, country, year, urban/rural, age, sex, GDP, life expectancy

**Methodology:**

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Univariate and multivariate analysis.
3. Data visualization (plots, charts, maps).
4. Statistical modeling (regression, correlation).

**Tools and Technologies:**

1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, STREMLIT).
2. Data visualization libraries (Plotly, Bokeh).
3. VS Code.

**outomes:**

1. Interactive dashboards showcasing population trends.
2. Insights on regional and country-level population dynamics.
3. Correlations between population and economic indicators.
4. Recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders.

**Keywords:** Exploratory Data Analysis, World Population, Data Visualization, Statistical Modeling, Demographic Analysis.
